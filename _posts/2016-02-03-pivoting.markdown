I've decided to change directions a bit with this project. I have a clear focus now for what I want to make and the features I want out of this project, and even better I've decided to go with a new technology.

#### Elixir

I've been reading [_Elixir in Action_][elixir-in-action] by Saša Jurić, in order to learn [Elixir][elixir-lang], and so far I really like it. It's the first real exposure I've had to functional programming. I plan to read Dave Thomas's [_Programming Elixir_][programming-elixir] next, followed by [_Metaprogramming Elixir_][metaprogramming-elixir], but I'm already getting more confident with the language. I've learned enough to debug a friend's project, and even start though [a Phoenix blog engine tutorial][phoenix-blog-tutorial]. Which brings me to my next point.

#### Phoenix

I've decided to ditch the Sinatra app and do this project in Elixir and [Phoenix][phoenix]. I've done part of a tutorial for Phoenix and I'm really excited to try out a new language and framework. And I think that a Phoenix based API will be great backing if I decide to make this into an iOS app in the future.

Until my next post, feel free to contact me on [twitter][twitter] or [email][email] me. See you soon!
