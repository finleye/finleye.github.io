With less complaining than Tumblr, and fewer feelings than Livejournal, I hope to make something here I can be proud of. I'll try to share things I learn while working on a side projects.

I'm working on my first post about a [Sinatra][sinatra] app I started working on over the weekend. Where I realized that a lot of my Ruby knowledge turned out to actually be Rails knowledge. I'm getting know know Rack better, and hopefully I'll figure out how I can host stuff *without* [Heroku][heroku].

In the mean time, get to know me though my [Twitter][twitter], [Instagram][instagram], or [GitHub][github]. Fell free to reach out on any of those, or email me at [finley.corey@gmail.com][email]!
