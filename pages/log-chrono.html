        <p>We made it! We're in Tokyo! We only had enough energy to walk around for an hour or two before getting some rest but so far is incredible. And a little overwhelming. I thought; "I live in NYC, and I've been to a lot of big cities. How different could it be?" but it's a bit of a sensory assualt. I'm sure how tired I was from the flight was a factor.</p>

          <p>Crossing near the 109 Building in Shibuya</p>
        </div>
        <p>The flight was really easy. We got pretty lucky and had a row of three seats for just the two of us. Which meant our bags could mostly fit under the middle seat and we each had plenty of leg room. In addition to that our seats were only seperated by a closet for the bathroom. So it was easy to get up as much as we needed to to stretch and walk a bit. There was a service gally close to our seats with "help yourself" snacks, ice lemon water, and coffee. I’m not sure if it was excitement or caffeine but I didn’t sleep a wink on the 14 hour flight. I just watched Seinfeld and played Zelda on my Switch. Lastly the food was actually really good. It was a lot of food and wasn’t the very basic snacks I’m used to for vegan options.</p>
        <p>When we landed in Tokyo we had zero trouble getting through immigration and customs. Maybe 10 minutes total for the two. After that we exchanged our Japan Rail pass voucher for the actual pass and got tickets for the train to Shibuya. I also got a Suica card with my name on it!</p>

        <p>Even just the train to Shibuya kind of blew my mind. First of all different kinds of trains stop at the same platform. A JR East train came through right before the NEX train. And even crazier to me was that the trains used the same platform in different directions. And even more incredible to me was that the NEX train split! All twelve cars went from Narita to Tokyo station, but at that point, the first six cars went to one destination, while the back six cars continued to the Shinjuku destination.</p>

        <p>We stepped into a drug store to try and grab some body wash. There were four packed floors and we only found pretty large size bottles of body wash. We started to get a bit overwhelmed by the crowd, so we stepped outside and I think it was actually more crowded out there. We just grabbed some snacks and headed back to the Airbnb to get some rest before our first full day here!</p>'

        <p>Our first full day in Tokyo was a lot of fun. Despite the rain we had a great time checking out a lot of shops in Shibuya including my long planned denim tour.</p>
        <p>We started out the day going to About Life coffee brewers. A really cute shop that had really incredible cofee.</p>

        <p>It was raining pretty hard at this point and I was a bit paranoid about my camera so we got a cheap umbrella at FamilyMart which is a very popular convenience store here. After grabbing that we headed to Don Quijote which is the "everything" store. It’s six floors, plus a basement that has pretty much everything you can imagine. We found stationary, pens, snacks, drinks (including a peach Coca-cola), and tons of other stuff. The best way that I can illustrate the full range of products they had is to say that after we walked through the shoe area, which had everything from cheap Payless style shoes to Nike AirMax, we walked pass the watch area that had a $25,000 Rolex watch which was about 15ft away from cheap bedroom slippers.</p>

        <p>We mostly got Japanese drug store type things from there, including some crazy cooling eye drops that are really refreshing. From there we went to Tokyo Hands which is a six floor crafts store. I was mostly looking for pens. I found a really nice embossed Pilot pen, and Ashley got a nice notebook to document our trip and a new planner!</p>
        <p>After Tokyo hands we started our Tokyo denim tour. The first stop was Studio D'Artisan. I have a pair of thier jeans that you can see at the bottom of my packing list post.<p>

        <p>Next up was Yoshida Porter which is a really nice Japan made bag and luggage brand. Sadly they were closed so we moved on to Pure Blue Japan where I got a really nice pair of Jeans. We stopped by The Flat Head, but they didn't have anything that really jumped out at me so we walked back to Porter where I got a nice little coin case zipper wallet.</p>

        <p>At this point we were pretty hungry so we stopped for something to eat. We went to a little cafe called Brown Rice that served an all vegan menu.</p>

        <p>From there we walked back to our Airbnb with the intention of putting our purchases down and getting back out but we ended up passing out. The time different caught up with us I think. I'm writting this Friday morning as we get ready to head out. We're going to the Iron Heart store in suburban Tokyo, and then returning to city center to checkout the imperial palace. See you tomorrow!</p>

<p>Today we went out to suburban Tokyo. A town called Hachioji. This hour long train ride, followed by a 30 minute bus ride was for one purpose; Iron Heart Japan. Iron Heart is a Japanese clothing company focused on long lasting tough clothes. Shinichi Haraki creates Iron Heat in 2003 aimed at the motorcycling community. The clothing style is what I think of as 1950’s Americana, and the inside of the shop reflected that aesthetic.</p>

<p>After our trip to Iron Heart we traveled back to the center of Tokyo, Tokyo Station. This is a massive bustling station. It was like a combination of Grand Central and Penn in one. Ashley and I had the goal of going to T’s Tan Tan, an all vegan ramen spot inside of Tokyo Station. Even though the train we were on arrived at this station, it still took us about half an hour to find T’s Tan Tan, but it was well worth it.</p>

        <p>Today Ashley and I went to Akihabara. The sign exiting the train said "Akihabara Electric Town." This part of Tokyo is for nerds of all varieties. Gaming nerd, manga and anime nerds, and even custom keyboard nerds. Our first stop off the train was in a gacha shop. Gacha machines are for where you put in ¥200-¥500 to get a random figure, keychain, or other small toy. We got a bunch of them. From cats, shibas, anime figures, to Pokémon costume hat for Ru.</p>

        <p>From there we went kept walking and found a arcade to go into. One of many on each block this arcade was 7 floors high. I played a couple fighting games, and crane games sadly not winning anything but still had a lot of fun!</p>

          <p>Arcade</p>
        </div>
        <p>From that arcade we went into another to do a プリクラ (purikura) meaning photo booth. These photo booths take instagram filters to a new level. You take a series of pictures, and then move into another booth to add writing and images to the pictures you just took. They’re pretty silly but it was a lot of fun making them.</p>

        </div>
        <p>After the photo booth, and losing a few more crane games we headed to wards another destination on my list but first realized we were right next to a famous cat cafe. Cat Cafe Mocha is a very popular location and got some of the best reviews online. It’s hard to find ones where the animals are well cared for but everything about Mocha seemed positive. There were strict rules about approaching the cats, not picking them up or chasing them, and they had small doors where they could exit if they didn’t want to be around people.</p>

        <p>The next spot on my list was 遊舎工房 Yusha Kobo Keyboard Specialty Shop. An entire shop, full of people, that was not only dedicated to keyboards, but custom built keyboards. You could buy kits with PCBs and instructions for building and everything else you would need. Switches, diodes, resistors, key caps, everything. They also sold bench time for the hour to use soldering irons and other electronics tool to build a board. I got a small key for a business card sized board that holds just for keys.</p>

       <p>Lastly, before leaving Akiba, we went into BIC Camera. It’s like if B&H sold everything, in addition to camera stuff. One floor was focused on PC gaming gear and I stumbled across the keyboard section. I had been wanting a small 40% board for a while and they had a really neat one so I had to get it.</p>

<p>I’m a little bit behind here. It’s Wednesday now in Kyoto and I’m going to try to catch up on the past couple days.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Ashley and I went to Hakone Open Air Museum. This is a large outdoor space near Odawara filled with large sculptures and installation art.</p>

<p>It took a long winding bus ride up a mountain after a short bullet train ride, but it was well worth it. This place was really special. We even got lucky enough to see some early cherry blosom blooms! The season doesn't officially start until right after we leave.</p>

<p>When we got back to Tokyo from Odawara, we mostly just spent the evening walking around Shibuya. While I’ve only been to a couple neighborhoods in Tokyo, Shibuya is my favorite so far.</p>

<p>Monday was just a travel day, but it was good because it gave us a chance to recharge from a lot of walking. We got up and finished packing and headed for the train station. We took a bullet train from Tokyo Station to Kyoto Station. We got to Tokyo station pretty early so walked around the underground mall below the station where we stumbled upon Character Street. This is a long strip of shops each dedicated to a popular animated character in Japan. I of course had to go into the Pokémon shop.</p>

<p>The past two days were spent time in Kyoto seeing a lot of different things. Our first full day here started with a trip to Arashiyama on the west side of Kyoto. Our first stop was Iwatayama Monkey Park which is inhabited by over 170 Japanese macaque monkeys. They have no fencing or enclosure, they move freely across the mountain and come to the park because guests give them nuts and pieces of fruit provided by the park staff.</p>

<p>The monkey park was a lot of fun, but quite a hike, so we had a way to go to get back down. Once back down to the walkable part of Arashiyama we went to the Tenryu-Ji Temple. This temple was build over 700 years ago.</p>

<p>We then went to Nonomiya Shrine which was built over 1300 years ago! In the Heian period (794AD-1185) successive imperial princesses would stay here for a year or more to purify themselves before becoming representatives of the imperial family. We got small fortunes and tied them up.</p>

<p>Ashley and I had originally planned to spend this part of the trip in Osaka, but after an excited recommendation from our friend Fabiola, we decided to change our plans and visit Naoshima. 直島町 is a small island off the coast of Kagawa. We took the train from Okayama to Uno port on the southern coast and then a short ferry to the island.</p>

<p>During the Edo Period this was often visited by the shogun, the ruling samurai. In the early 20th century much of the island was purchased by Mitsubishi to be used as a refinery. Finally in the 1990’s much of the island was purchased to build some of the worlds best art museums. In 1992, The Benesse House Museum opened.</p>

<p>We walked from there and saw some of the outdoor installations. Our next stop was Chichu Museum. Chichu litterally translates to "in the ground" which is appropriate because this museum was build with no exterior projections. The architect, Tadao Ando refused to let any part of the museum be above ground in order to preserve the scenery of the hill top.</p>

<p>I only got a single picture of the outside because photos are strictly prohibited, which I think is best because no picture can do it justice. I was totally taken aback by this place. It started off with a beautiful Monet collection, including the 2m x 6m "Water-lily pond" at its center. From there you get to go into James Turrell’s "Open Field" which was one of the surreal things I’ve ever experienced. This museum was something I’ll never forget, and if you have the opportunity to visit Japan, I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Hello from Berlin! It’s about 10:30pm here on Saturday March 30th. I got into Berlin yesterday and spent some time walking around before making my way back to the Airbnb where I’m staying in Kreuzberg, Berlin. The first thing I took a picture of here in Berlin was an off leash pup.</p>
        <div
          class="inline-image placeholder"
          data-img="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vn6pgecx4r30lzd/05D49E0A-1295-4383-80FE-0B9F65BC05CD-opt.jpeg?dl=0">

<p>There are a lot of dogs in Berlin and the majority of them are off leash just trotting along next to, or a few paces ahead of, their human. I was pretty hungry after being in transit for almost 12 hours, so my first stop in Berlin was Hum Vegan Cuisine. The description on their site is simply "Asian" food. I had a noodle soup with a thin vegetable broth and fried dumplings in the soup. The soup was tasty and filling. I relaxed here for a bit and then got back to walking, headed towards some denim stores I had looked up before.

          <p>Walking in Berlin</p>
        </div>
        
<p>I stopped into Fein und Ripp. This shop sells a lot of new German made clothes as well as some vintage. The style is kind of 19th century. You can see their <a href="https://www.feinundripp.de/index.html">website</a> to get an idea of what I mean.</p>
        <div
          class="inline-image placeholder"
          data-img="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s7gy7gci6suly5o/F49EEFE7-6F4F-4D2D-9345-01324C2E942E-opt.jpeg?dl=0">

        </div>
<p>After Fein und Ripp I went to another denim store called DC4 that had a lot of cool stuff. I was tempted by a black pair of Oni jeans. Maybe I'll be back for those.</p>
<p>Around the corner from DC4 was the Berlin Wall Memorial. I saw a preserved piece of the wall from the east side.</p>
        <div
          class="inline-image placeholder"
          data-img="https://www.dropbox.com/s/upabhu1ozbr1r8c/04362919-E271-4D9D-A219-78DE9BB5F9FD-opt.jpeg?dl=0">

          <p>The east side of part of the Berlin Wall</p>
        </div>
<p>This whole area has markers of where the wall once stood and large pictures of what the area looked like before, during, and after the wall stood. It’s really fascinating to me to see a timeline of the place your standing through history. It was early in the afternoon, but I had been awake for something like 36 hours, so I headed to check into the Airbnb where I’m staying. The place is very nice and one of the few Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in that is actually lived in. It feels more homey and comfortable than the ones that are run like hotels.</p>

<p>Saturday morning I slept in pretty late. Though in fairness, it was 6am in New York which is the time I normally wake up. I got out and just started walking the neighborhood. I walked through a market that was set up along the river and then stopped at Brammibal’s Donuts, an all vegan donut shop.</p>

          <p>Not patient enough to take a pic before a bite</p>
        </div>
<p>I’m not sure if it’s better than Dunwell in New York. The donuts were fluffier and lighter but also less sweet which to me defeats the purpose of a donut. From there I just walk around kind of aimlessly.</p>

<p>While waiting for a bus on Naoshima in Japan, Ashley and I started talking to some other people traveling. It turned out they were visiting from Berlin so I asked for recommendations. One place they recommended was Werkbundarchiv - Museum der Dinge or Museum of Things. This place was really cool. It was all things made in Germany and it spanned from the early 20th century to the early 2000s. It showed the evolution of design and the aesthetic change. It had an area that also showed the contrast of items produced in East and West Germany.</p>

<p>Mitte is neighborhood of Berlin that I went to for Burg & Shild, another denim shop. I wasn’t looking for jeans but they carry this brand Merz b. Schwanen, a company that makes simple but high quality clothes in Germany. I got a black T-shirt but I might be back for more later on this trip.</p>

          <p>A park I sat in for a bit</p>
        </div>
<p>I kind of just hung around this area for the evening. It reminded me a lot of SoHo in New York. Once it got dark, I got back on the train to visit the Brandenburg Gate.</p>

          <p>Brandenburg Gate</p>
        </div>
<p>The Brandenburg Gate was commissioned by Frederick William II of Prussia and built between 1788 and 1791. It replaced simple guard towers that were the entrance to Berlin. It was used as a political symbol by many of Germany’s leaders including Hitler in the 1930’s. Though it survived World War II it was badly damaged, and during the Cold War in a joint effort between East and West it was restored. It has since undergone more restoration and is now blocked to vehicle traffic. From there I took a short walk to the Reichstag building. </p>

          <p>Corner of the Reichstag building</p>
        </div>
<p>Originally opened in 1894 to house the German Parliament, the building was used as the center of German government until 1933 when it was mostly destroyed in a fire. The Nazi party had taken majority of control of parliament in 1932 and by January of 1933, Adolf Hitler was declared the Chancellor of Germany. On February 27th, 1933 the building caught fire under circumstances still not fully known. Hitler used this fire as a pretext for suppressing political opponents and the next day convinced the Reich President to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree. Taking advantage of emergency powers outlined in the Weimar Constition (signed only 23 years earlier) the decree suspended most of the civil liberties guaranteed to Germans by same document. This was a key step in silencing opponents and political dissidents by granting power to police to arrest outspoken critics and members of opposition parties. Less than a month later, on March 23rd, parliament passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which allowed the cabinet to pass laws without the consent of parliament. This new law effectively gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Soon after, other political parties were outlawed and Germany became a single party state. This is all very heavy, knowing what all happened next, but it’s an important part of history.</p>

<p>I went from here back to Kruezburg to relax and write this post. I’ll try to write up another post tomorrow after I get back. Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>It’s been a few days since I posted but that’s mostly because the thing that pushes me most to add updates are the photos I’ve taken and I haven’t carried my camera the past couple days. The reason I haven’t carried my camera the past few days is this; Germans stare. They stare a lot. In the US we’re raised that staring is rude and in some cases even considered aggressive. So I spent my first couple days here feeling like an alien or like I had an extra limb because people stared at me a lot. It made me really self conscious. Ashley took the initiative that I didn’t to Google it and found that it’s just a German cultural thing. They don’t think it’s rude or invasive to stare they just look at each other more. All this to say that I thought maybe carrying my camera made me stick out as a tourist and I just wanted to blend in. After learning that staring is just something Germans do, it made it much easier to ignore.</p>

<p>A couple other observations about Berlin:
<br>
- People are friendly and will quickly switch to English when you look blankly at them. In some places they’ll just 
first ask "Deutsche oder englisch?"
<br>
- "How are you?" Is answered honestly. It’s not just a common pleasantry.
<br>
- People here don’t jaywalk. I don’t understand it. There are no cars but they act like there is some sort of force field preventing them from crossing until the sign turns green.
<br>
- The vegan food is amazing and it’s everywhere. In New York there are plenty of options, but nearly every food place I walk by here has something vegan on the menu.
<br>
- Everyone wears all black. I thought New Yorkers dressed pretty dark, but the majority of people here are wearing black or dark colors head to toe. I’m into it.
<br>
- Very few people walk around with headphones in. This really surprised me. In New York and everywhere we went in Japan, most people have headphones in walking around or on public transit. Probably 80% of people are listening to something. Here, I’d say it’s closer to 10% or less.
</p>

<p>The past couple days have been mostly spent in museums. I do have some photos but they’re from my phone so they’re not great. </p>

<p>On Sunday I went to Topography of Terror. This is built on the site of the former SS headquarters. This museum shows the timeline of the Nazi rise and then how this location was used to architect and orchestrate the holocaust. It was very moving but sickening to see.</p>

<p>I went from there to Checkpoint Charlie which was the most famous point of crossing the Berlin Wall. I was surprised by how much it felt like a theme park attraction now.</p>

<p>On Monday I visited the Jewish Museum which is mostly a memorial for the holocaust. It’s very moving. The museum itself is built to be kind of maze like with confusing perspectives. Hallways look long and the angles are jagged. I think this is meant to make you feel confused and like you don’t know where to turn, much like the Jews of Europe in the 1930’s and 1940’s. There are two very impactful pieces in this part of the museum. The first I went into was called Holocaust Tower. You enter the base of a three story tower with only a small sliver of light at the top. It’s like being at the bottom of a well. There were some others guests in there when I walked in but after they left and I was alone, it quickly became overwhelming. I’m sure this was the architect’s intention. Another large work that’s very moving is called Memory Void.</p>

<p>This is a large open section where the floor is covered with hundreds of metal plates that have a haunting face of anguish on them. I image each plate represents thousands of lives lost during the holocaust.</p>

<p>After the Jewish museum I visited Berliniche Galerie, a modern art museum one block over. This museum was pretty small but it had a lot of really cool pieces.</p>
        <div
          class="inline-image placeholder"

<p>One thing I thought was really interesting was how they had small 3D renderings of the more prominent pieces. This small versions are for the vision impaired guests. They’re able to feel the art.</p>

<p>Tuesday I went to what’s called Museum Island. It’s a small island in the Spree river that has 5 large museums. I visited two of the five. The first is called Pergamonmuseum, an ancient history museum. The first thing you see here is The Eighth Gate of Babylon, called the Ishtar Gate.</p>
        <div
          class="inline-image placeholder"
          data-img="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ch8je5yau6z39hd/IMG_1150-opt.jpeg?dl=0">

          </a>
          <p>A miniature recreation of the Ishtar gate how it was originally used</p>
        </div>
<p>The gate was originally built by King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon in 575 BCE. It was excavated from present day Hillah, Iraq, 53 miles south of Baghdad, from 1902 to 1914, then moved brick by brick to Berlin and completed in 1930. The gate stands 46 ft tall and 100 ft wide. It’s really impressive to stand in front of something 2,600 years old.</p>

<p>Another piece that struck me in the museum was this one.</p>
        <div
          class="inline-image placeholder"
          data-img="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ea74m8xp5zvgoe7/IMG_1148-opt.jpeg?dl=0">

          </a>
          <p>Authentication stamp</p>
        </div>
<p>The small white cylinder on the left is a stamp. It rolls out as seen on the red clay to the right of it. This was used as a signature to authenticate documents and contracts. The really mind blowing thing about it is that it’s from around 2,500 BCE. 4,500 years ago, a person made this as a way to prevent forgery.</p>

<p>Today was pretty lazy. I walked over to a small coffee shop close to my Airbnb called Okay Cafe. I had a great breakfast of overnight oats and fruit and just sat and wrote in my travel journal most of the morning. I also tried to plan out what I’ll do tomorrow. The cafe did have a very cute dog that would walk in every 20 minutes or so to check for crumbs under each table and then move a long.</p>

<p>From there I went to the East Side Gallery. A series of paintings done on the east side of the Berlin Wall. Frustratingly though I only took a couple pictures of the West side of that wall which was the same kind of street art you see all over Berlin.</p>
