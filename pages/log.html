<p>After our trip to Iron Heart we traveled back to the center of Tokyo, Tokyo Station. This is a massive bustling station. It was like a combination of Grand Central and Penn in one. Ashley and I had the goal of going to T’s Tan Tan, an all vegan ramen spot inside of Tokyo Station. Even though the train we were on arrived at this station, it still took us about half an hour to find T’s Tan Tan, but it was well worth it.</p>

<p>Today we went out to suburban Tokyo. A town called Hachioji. This hour long train ride, followed by a 30 minute bus ride was for one purpose; Iron Heart Japan. Iron Heart is a Japanese clothing company focused on long lasting tough clothes. Shinichi Haraki creates Iron Heat in 2003 aimed at the motorcycling community. The clothing style is what I think of as 1950’s Americana, and the inside of the shop reflected that aesthetic.</p>

<p>They asked us about our trip and we’re excited to hear we were on our honeymoon and when we checked out they threw in many gifts including stickers, patches, and drawstring denim bags. After we left the shop on a high from how fun the visit was, they chased us down and asked to take a picture of us in front of the shop for their blog!</p>

        <p>Our first full day in Tokyo was a lot of fun. Despite the rain we had a great time checking out a lot of shops in Shibuya including my long planned denim tour.</p>
        <p>We started out the day going to About Life coffee brewers. A really cute shop that had really incredible cofee.</p>

        <p>It was raining pretty hard at this point and I was a bit paranoid about my camera so we got a cheap umbrella at FamilyMart which is a very popular convenience store here. After grabbing that we headed to Don Quijote which is the "everything" store. It’s six floors, plus a basement that has pretty much everything you can imagine. We found stationary, pens, snacks, drinks (including a peach Coca-cola), and tons of other stuff. The best way that I can illustrate the full range of products they had is to say that after we walked through the shoe area, which had everything from cheap Payless style shoes to Nike AirMax, we walked pass the watch area that had a $25,000 Rolex watch which was about 15ft away from cheap bedroom slippers.</p>

        <p>We mostly got Japanese drug store type things from there, including some crazy cooling eye drops that are really refreshing. From there we went to Tokyo Hands which is a six floor crafts store. I was mostly looking for pens. I found a really nice embossed Pilot pen, and Ashley got a nice notebook to document our trip and a new planner!</p>
        <p>After Tokyo hands we started our Tokyo denim tour. The first stop was Studio D'Artisan. I have a pair of thier jeans that you can see at the bottom of my packing list post.<p>

        <p>Next up was Yoshida Porter which is a really nice Japan made bag and luggage brand. Sadly they were closed so we moved on to Pure Blue Japan where I got a really nice pair of Jeans. We stopped by The Flat Head, but they didn't have anything that really jumped out at me so we walked back to Porter where I got a nice little coin case zipper wallet.</p>

        <p>At this point we were pretty hungry so we stopped for something to eat. We went to a little cafe called Brown Rice that served an all vegan menu.</p>

        </div>
        <p>From there we walked back to our Airbnb with the intention of putting our purchases down and getting back out but we ended up passing out. The time different caught up with us I think. I'm writting this Friday morning as we get ready to head out. We're going to the Iron Heart store in suburban Tokyo, and then returning to city center to checkout the imperial palace. See you tomorrow!</p>

        <p>We made it! We're in Tokyo! We only had enough energy to walk around for an hour or two before getting some rest but so far is incredible. And a little overwhelming. I thought; "I live in NYC, and I've been to a lot of big cities. How different could it be?" but it's a bit of a sensory assualt. I'm sure how tired I was from the flight was a factor.</p>

          <p>Crossing near the 109 Building in Shibuya</p>
        </div>
        <p>The flight was really easy. We got pretty lucky and had a row of three seats for just the two of us. Which meant our bags could mostly fit under the middle seat and we each had plenty of leg room. In addition to that our seats were only seperated by a closet for the bathroom. So it was easy to get up as much as we needed to to stretch and walk a bit. There was a service gally close to our seats with "help yourself" snacks, ice lemon water, and coffee. I’m not sure if it was excitement or caffeine but I didn’t sleep a wink on the 14 hour flight. I just watched Seinfeld and played Zelda on my Switch. Lastly the food was actually really good. It was a lot of food and wasn’t the very basic snacks I’m used to for vegan options.</p>
        <p>When we landed in Tokyo we had zero trouble getting through immigration and customs. Maybe 10 minutes total for the two. After that we exchanged our Japan Rail pass voucher for the actual pass and got tickets for the train to Shibuya. I also got a Suica card with my name on it!</p>
        <div

        </div>
        <p>Even just the train to Shibuya kind of blew my mind. First of all different kinds of trains stop at the same platform. A JR East train came through right before the NEX train. And even crazier to me was that the trains used the same platform in different directions. And even more incredible to me was that the NEX train split! All twelve cars went from Narita to Tokyo station, but at that point, the first six cars went to one destination, while the back six cars continued to the Shinjuku destination.</p>

        </div>
        <p>We stepped into a drug store to try and grab some body wash. There were four packed floors and we only found pretty large size bottles of body wash. We started to get a bit overwhelmed by the crowd, so we stepped outside and I think it was actually more crowded out there. We just grabbed some snacks and headed back to the Airbnb to get some rest before our first full day here!</p>'

        <p>I like over optimizing packing and traveling as light as possible. On my trip to Japan I plan to carry just this backpack. I'll caviat that by saying I do plan to buy a lot while I’m there. Including another bag to fill with things to bring home. But leaving New York, this is all I’ll have with me.</p>

        <p>This is my Mission Workshop R6 Arkiv Pack (22L). I'm using the two of the vertical side zip attachments, one on each side, the Axis waist pack is attached to the front on top, and the front bottom attachment is actually a GoRuck GR1 field pocket using Mission Workshop's Arkiv clips to attach using the molle straps.</p>

        </div>

      <p>We're staying at Airbnb's on our trip so I can travel really light when it comes to clothes. I'm taking four boxer briefs, four pairs of socks, one gym shirt, running shorts, and two plain cotton tees. I'm also carrying a small clothes line because I don't like to dry my shirts and risk shrinking them. It took a long time to find my favorite plain tees but the 3sixteen heavyweight tee is my go-to.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The top left is a small battery bank by Anker. It has two USB out ports, and has built in prongs to plug right into the wall. I'm also bringing an HDMI cable and adapter to put The Office or Seinfeld on the TV where we're staying.</p>

          <p>Camera gear</p>
        </div>
        <p>My camera gear is pretty light. I shoot on a Fujifilm X-T2 using their 35mm lens. Because of the APS-C sensor the lens is an effective 50mm but that's a good length for how I shoot. I'm using Peak Design's strap system, and a Pelican SD card case.</p>

          <p>Packed camera gear</p>
        </div>
        <p>This is Peak Design's Wash Pack. It's, of course, a great dopp kit bag, but for travel I want to carry as little as possible when it comes to toiletries. Thanks to the organization in this pouch, It makes a great camera pack. All my camera gear is packed and safe in here.</p>

        On my upcoming trips I plan to post updates here. I'll add pictures I take and things I do. I'll more frequently be posting on my Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cfinley/">@cfinley</a>. I'm also into posts about pack lists and fitting what I need into a single bag, so I'll be doing that a couple days before my trip. Until then, here's a picture of my cat.
